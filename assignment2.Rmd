## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r getting data & cleaning}

gdp <- WDI(
  start = 1992,
  end = 2018
)

co2 <- WDI(
  start = 1992,
  end = 2018,
  indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC"
)

data <- left_join(
  x = gdp,
  y = co2,
)

data <- tail(data, -1323) # keeping only the countries

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
