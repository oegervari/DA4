## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r getting data & cleaning}
#gdp
#keeping only countries and  removing country codes
gdp <- WDI(
  start = 1992,
  end = 2018
) %>% tail( -1323) %>% select(-1)

#transforming df to wide for easier filtering of any countries, which have NAs in any year
wide_gdp <- gdp %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = year, 
  values_from = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD) %>% drop_na()

#transforming back to long format
gdp <- wide_gdp %>% pivot_longer(
  !country, 
  names_to = "year",
  values_to = c("NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")
)
#co2
co2 <- WDI(
  start = 1992,
  end = 2018,
  indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC"
) %>% tail( -1323) %>% select(-1)

wide_co2 <- co2 %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = year, 
  values_from = EN.ATM.CO2E.PC) %>% drop_na()

co2 <- wide_co2 %>% pivot_longer(
  !country, 
  names_to = "year",
  values_to = c("EN.ATM.CO2E.PC")
)

#joining co2 and gdp tables
data <- inner_join(
  x = gdp,
  y = co2,
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
